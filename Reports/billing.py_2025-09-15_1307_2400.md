## LLM Summary

## Linting Report Summary

**Critical Issues:**

*   **Missing final newline:** `billing.py` is missing a final newline character, violating POSIX standards and potentially causing issues with some tools.
*   **High Cyclomatic Complexity:** The `calculate_discount` function has a complexity grade of B (7), indicating it's moderately complex and potentially difficult to understand and maintain. `process_order` also has a complexity grade of B (6).
*   **Too many nested blocks:** The `calculate_discount` function has too many nested blocks (6/5), making it harder to read and follow.

**Recurring Patterns:**

*   **Missing Docstrings:** The module and the `unused_helper` function are missing docstrings, hindering readability and maintainability.
*   **Whitespace Issues:** Flake8 reports missing blank lines before function definitions and missing newline at end of file.
*   **Unused Arguments/Variables:** The `product` argument in `calculate_discount` is unused.

**Overall Code Quality Assessment:**

The code has several style and complexity issues that impact readability and maintainability. While the code isn't inherently insecure (Bandit found no issues), the complexity of the `calculate_discount` function and the lack of documentation are concerning. The maintainability index is A (55.62), which is good, but can be improved by addressing the identified issues.

**Actionable Recommendations:**

1.  **Add missing final newline:** Ensure the file ends with a newline character.
2.  **Add module and function docstrings:** Provide clear explanations of the module's purpose and each function's behavior, arguments, and return values.
3.  **Reduce complexity of `calculate_discount`:** Refactor the function to reduce nesting and improve readability. Consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions.
4.  **Remove unused arguments/variables:** Eliminate the unused `product` argument from the `calculate_discount` function.
5.  **Address whitespace issues:** Add the expected blank lines before function definitions.
6.  **Consider removing or using `unused_helper`:** If the `unused_helper` function is truly unused, remove it. Otherwise, implement its intended functionality.
