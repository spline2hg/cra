## 🛠️ Actionable Recommendations & Fixes

### 🟡 High-Priority Issues

**1. Reduce Complexity of `calculate_discount` Function**
- **File:** `Examples/billing.py:1`
- **Category:** Complexity, Code Smell
- **Impact:** The `calculate_discount` function has too many arguments (7) and too many nested blocks (6). This makes the function difficult to understand, test, and maintain. It violates the principle of keeping functions focused and concise.
- **Fix Example:**
  **Before**
  ```python
  def calculate_discount(customer_type, order_total, num_items, has_coupon, product, shipping_country, is_new_customer):
      if customer_type == "premium":
          if order_total > 100:
              if num_items > 5:
                  if has_coupon:
                      if shipping_country == "USA":
                          if is_new_customer:
                              discount = 0.25
                          else:
                              discount = 0.20
                      else:
                          discount = 0.15
                  else:
                      discount = 0.10
              else:
                  discount = 0.05
          else:
              discount = 0.02
      else:
          discount = 0.0
      return discount
  ```
  **After**
  ```python
  def calculate_discount(customer_type, order_total, num_items, has_coupon, shipping_country, is_new_customer):
      """
      Calculates the discount based on customer type, order details, and shipping location.
      """
      discount = 0.0

      if customer_type == "premium":
          if order_total > 100 and num_items > 5:
              discount = 0.25 if has_coupon and shipping_country == "USA" and is_new_customer else 0.20
          elif order_total > 100:
              discount = 0.05
          else:
              discount = 0.02

      return discount
  ```
  **Explanation:**
    *   Removed the unused `product` argument.
    *   Reduced nesting by combining conditions where possible.
    *   Consider refactoring further by extracting discount calculation logic into smaller, more focused functions.

**2. Address `unused_helper` Function**
- **File:** `Examples/billing.py:44`
- **Category:** Code Smell, Maintainability
- **Impact:** The `unused_helper` function lacks a docstring and its purpose is unclear. If the function is truly unused, it adds unnecessary clutter to the codebase.
- **Fix Example:**
  **Before**
  ```python
  def unused_helper(x):
      return x + 1
  ```
  **After (Option 1: Add Docstring and Use)**
  ```python
  def unused_helper(x):
      """
      A helper function that increments a number by 1.
      """
      return x + 1

  # Example usage (replace with actual use case)
  result = unused_helper(5)
  print(result)
  ```
  **After (Option 2: Remove if Unused)**
  ```python
  # No code here - function is removed
  ```
  **Explanation:**
    *   **Option 1:** If the function has a purpose, add a clear docstring explaining its functionality and ensure it is used appropriately within the codebase.
    *   **Option 2:** If the function is truly unused (as indicated by Vulture), remove it to simplify the code and improve maintainability.

### 🟢 Medium-Priority Issues

**1. Add Final Newline Character**
- **File:** `Examples/billing.py:45`
- **Category:** Style
- **Impact:** Missing final newline characters can cause minor issues with some text editors and version control systems.
- **Fix Example:**
  **Before**
  ```python
  print("Order processed successfully")
  ```
  **After**
  ```python
  print("Order processed successfully")

  ```
  **Explanation:**
    *   Simply add a newline character at the end of the file.

**2. Add Module Docstring**
- **File:** `Examples/billing.py:1`
- **Category:** Documentation
- **Impact:** Missing module docstrings make it harder to understand the purpose of the module at a glance.
- **Fix Example:**
  **Before**
  ```python
  def calculate_discount(customer_type, order_total, num_items, has_coupon, product, shipping_country, is_new_customer):
      # ...
  ```
  **After**
  ```python
  """
  This module provides functions for calculating discounts and processing orders.
  """
  def calculate_discount(customer_type, order_total, num_items, has_coupon, product, shipping_country, is_new_customer):
      # ...
  ```
  **Explanation:**
    *   Add a docstring at the beginning of the file explaining the module's purpose.

### ⚪ Low-Priority Issues

**1. Blank Lines Inconsistency**
- **File:** `Examples/billing.py:25, 44`
- **Category:** Style
- **Impact:** Inconsistent blank lines can affect code readability.
- **Fix Example:**
  **Before**
  ```python
  def some_function():
      pass

  def another_function():
      pass
  ```
  **After**
  ```python
  def some_function():
      pass


  def another_function():
      pass
  ```
  **Explanation:**
    *   Ensure there are two blank lines before function definitions.

📊 Overall Code Quality Assessment

### Complexity Analysis

| Method / Function | File | Complexity Score | Rating |
|-------------------|------|------------------|--------|
| calculate_discount | Examples/billing.py | 7 | 🟡 Medium |
| process_order | Examples/billing.py | 6 | 🟡 Medium |
| unused_helper | Examples/billing.py | 1 | 🟢 Low |

Scores > 10 are considered high and may require refactoring.

### Recurring Patterns & Themes

*   **Long Parameter Lists:** The `calculate_discount` function has a long parameter list, which can be a sign of a function doing too much. Consider using data structures (e.g., dictionaries or objects) to group related parameters.
*   **Missing Docstrings:** Several functions are missing docstrings. Adding docstrings improves code readability and maintainability.

### General Observations & Strengths

The codebase is relatively small and doesn't have any identified security vulnerabilities. The Radon Maintainability Index is good (A), indicating that the code is relatively easy to understand and maintain. However, there are opportunities to improve code clarity and reduce complexity by addressing the issues identified in this report.
